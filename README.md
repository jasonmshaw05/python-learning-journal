A repository to document my Python learning journey
**About me**
  I am a community college student trying to relearn Python. I have a long history with Python, but haven't touched it in years. Now, as a prerequisite to transfer to a university, I'm revisiting the language more in-depth in an attempt to learn its nuances and apply said knowledge to my upper division learning. Though I haven't dealt with Python in a while, I took a Java course in my senior year of high school, in which I did pretty well. So, after a bit of self studying, I feel pretty confident starting my coding journey here!
**Goals for this Course**
  I have a couple goals for this course. First of all, as a more abstract goal, I would like to learn how to do things as efficiently as possible when programming. Since all of my experience with Python has been on my own through self-teaching, I feel the way that I have learned to do things may be laden with redundancy due to not knowing a better way. Correcting bad coding habits is a paramount goal for me. Another achievement for me would also be to properly learn how to use data structures and sorting algorithms. Both of these seem to be at the core of my learning in my college course, so to master both would be incredibly helpful. Finally, I aim to earn an A in the class, not only through understanding of the course, but also constant participation and proficiency in completing assignments.
**My First Python Program**
print('Hello, World!')
