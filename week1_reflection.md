So far, I've mastered a lot of the basic of Python. I'm not sure where CIST05A worked up to, but so far I have a good handle on variables, conditional execution, loops, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and things of that nature. However, I'm still a decently unknowledgeable on network programming, web services, object-oriented programming, and databases. I've been using the online service Python for Everybody, but unfortunately haven't been able to finish it before the start of the spring semester. However, I've been successful in completing all of the coding projects up until where I paused in the course.
